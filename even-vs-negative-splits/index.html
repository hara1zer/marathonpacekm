<p class="muted">Most marathoners slow down in the second half. The goal of a pacing strategy isn’t to “be brave” early — it’s to arrive at 30–35km with enough energy to keep running well.</p>

<h2>Quick definitions</h2>
<ul class="muted">
<li><strong>Even splits:</strong> you aim to run the same pace throughout.</li>
<li><strong>Negative splits:</strong> the second half is slightly faster than the first.</li>
<li><strong>Even effort:</strong> you keep effort steady (pace may vary with hills/wind/heat). This is often the smartest real-world approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When even splits works best</h2>
<p class="muted">Even splits can be excellent when the course and conditions make them realistic:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li>Flat or gently rolling courses</li>
<li>Cool, stable weather</li>
<li>Experienced runners who know their true marathon pace</li>
<li>Strong fueling habits (so the second half doesn’t become a survival shuffle)</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">Even splits is simple to execute — but it leaves less margin for error if you misjudge fitness or the day turns tough.</p>
<h2>When negative splits is the better bet</h2>
<p class="muted">For most runners, a <strong>slight</strong> negative split (or at least a controlled first half) improves your chance of a good result:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li>Your first attempt at a goal time</li>
<li>Crowded starts where it’s easy to get carried away</li>
<li>Courses with “late-race cost” (bridges, exposed sections, rolling late hills)</li>
<li>Any day where you’re unsure about weather or pacing</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">The real advantage: negative-split thinking forces <strong>patience</strong> early — and patience is what saves your last 12km.</p>
<h2>How big should a negative split be?</h2>
<p class="muted">Keep it realistic. Huge negative splits are rare outside elite racing. A practical target for many runners is:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li><strong>Halfway:</strong> 30–90 seconds slower than strict even-pace (conservative).</li>
<li><strong>Second half:</strong> equal or up to ~1–3 minutes faster than the first half (only if you’re under control at 30km).</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">If conditions are hot or hilly, replace “negative split” with <strong>even effort</strong> and judge success by how well you hold form late.</p>
<h2>Even pace vs even effort (the missing concept)</h2>
<p class="muted">Most real races are not perfectly flat, calm, and cool. That’s why many runners do better thinking in <strong>even effort</strong>:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li>On hills, let pace drift slower uphill and recover naturally downhill.</li>
<li>Into headwinds, keep effort steady and accept a slower pace.</li>
<li>In heat, start conservatively and aim to keep form late rather than forcing early pace.</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">If you keep effort controlled early, you give yourself permission to race late — which is where your time is actually decided.</p>
<h2>Decision checklist (2 minutes)</h2>
<ul class="muted">
<li><strong>Hot / windy / hilly?</strong> Choose even effort (pace will vary).</li>
<li><strong>First time at this goal?</strong> Lean conservative early.</li>
<li><strong>Long runs felt controlled late?</strong> You can attempt closer to even splits.</li>
<li><strong>Unsure?</strong> Start controlled and “earn” speed after 30km.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A practical pacing plan (that actually works)</h2>
<ul class="muted">
<li><strong>0–3 km:</strong> 2–5 sec/km slower than target while you settle and find space.</li>
<li><strong>3–25 km:</strong> lock into goal rhythm. Smooth, relaxed, fuel early.</li>
<li><strong>25–32 km:</strong> protect cadence and posture. Avoid surges. Stay calm.</li>
<li><strong>32–42 km:</strong> race by effort and form. If you feel strong at 35–37km, squeeze gradually.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Worked example: a “safe” 4:30 plan</h2>
<p class="muted">If your goal is 4:30:00, your strict checkpoint targets are roughly:</p>
<table class="muted" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:8px">
<tr><th style="text-align:left;padding:6px 0;border-bottom:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.12)">Checkpoint</th><th style="text-align:left;padding:6px 0;border-bottom:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.12)">Target time</th></tr>
<tr><td style="padding:6px 0">10 km</td><td style="padding:6px 0">1:03:59</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding:6px 0">Half marathon</td><td style="padding:6px 0">2:15:00</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding:6px 0">30 km</td><td style="padding:6px 0">3:11:58</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding:6px 0">40 km</td><td style="padding:6px 0">4:15:57</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px">A conservative negative-split mindset could mean arriving at halfway 30–60 seconds “behind” those targets — then trying to hold steady effort through 30km before pushing late if you still feel good.</p>
<h2>What if you started too fast?</h2>
<p class="muted">This happens — especially with adrenaline and crowds. The fix is immediate and unemotional:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li>Slow down to controlled effort for 2–3 km (don’t “fight” the pace)</li>
<li>Resume goal rhythm once breathing normalizes</li>
<li>Fuel and hydrate as planned (don’t skip because you’re “behind”)</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">Trying to “win back” 30–60 seconds with a surge often costs minutes later.</p>
<h2>Fueling: the hidden split strategy</h2>
<p class="muted">Late slowdowns are often as much about fueling as fitness. A pacing plan that includes consistent fueling is easier to hold:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li>Start fueling early (don’t wait until you feel empty).</li>
<li>Keep effort controlled early so your stomach can absorb.</li>
<li>If you miss a gel or two, don’t compensate with a surge — get back on schedule calmly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use goal pages for exact targets</h2>
<p class="muted">For exact splits and checkpoint targets, use the calculator and your goal-time pages:</p>

<h2>Pacing for a PB vs pacing to finish strong</h2>
<p class="muted">Your split choice should match your goal:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li><strong>Chasing a PB:</strong> start controlled, aim for even effort, and only push if you’re still composed after 30km.</li>
<li><strong>Finishing strong:</strong> be more conservative early (slight negative-split mindset), fuel consistently, and protect your legs for the last 12km.</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">Both approaches reward patience. The difference is how aggressively you’re willing to “spend” effort after 30–35km.</p>
<h2>Checkpoint anchors that prevent blow-ups</h2>
<p class="muted">If you only watch a few numbers, watch these:</p>
<ul class="muted">
<li><strong>10 km:</strong> relaxed, controlled, breathing easy.</li>
<li><strong>Half marathon:</strong> still smooth; fueling on track.</li>
<li><strong>30 km:</strong> posture + cadence steady. If you’re straining here, you went too hard early.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common mistakes that ruin pacing</h2>
<ul class="muted">
<li><strong>Banking time:</strong> “I’ll save minutes now” usually becomes “I’m bleeding minutes later”.</li>
<li><strong>Chasing instant pace:</strong> GPS noise causes over-corrections and wasted energy.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring conditions:</strong> heat and wind require effort-based pacing.</li>
<li><strong>Racing the first half:</strong> your race begins around 30km, not 5km.</li>
</ul>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div class="muted">
<p><strong>Is negative split always best?</strong><br/>Not always. On hot, windy, or hilly courses, “even effort” is often better than chasing an exact negative split.</p>
<p><strong>What should my halfway split be?</strong><br/>If you’re pacing conservatively, being 30–90 seconds slower than strict even-pace is common and can set up a stronger finish.</p>
<p><strong>Can beginners run even splits?</strong><br/>It’s possible, but beginners are more likely to benefit from a conservative first half to reduce blow-up risk.</p>
<p><strong>What if I feel amazing at 10km?</strong><br/>Great — keep it controlled. Feeling great at 10km is normal. The goal is to feel “still okay” at 32km.</p>
<p><strong>Should I speed up if I’m behind the pace chart?</strong><br/>Usually no. Return to your planned effort and rhythm. Avoid surges; they’re expensive.</p>
<p><strong>How do I pace hills?</strong><br/>Run even effort: accept a slower pace uphill, and regain gently downhill without spiking effort.</p>
<p><strong>Does fueling affect split strategy?</strong><br/>Yes. Poor fueling increases late-race slowdown. A disciplined first half plus consistent fueling improves your chance of holding pace late.</p>
